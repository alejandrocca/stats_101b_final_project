# Abstract

  s

  Melatonin is most commonly known as a supplement that is consumed to help induce sleep quickly, especially amongst the elderly. Biologically, melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland that regulates peoples' sleep cycle. It controls one's biological clock and can be affected in several ways- age, exposure to light, and dietary habits etc. In a few biomedical articles, we discovered that exercise resulted in a shift of nocturnal melatonin levels. Knowing that light exposure also affects melatonin levels, we wished to investigate the extent to which exercise intensity and time of the day it was performed affects one's blood melatonin levels. The experiment design utilized was the Randomized 2^2 Factorial with blocking. We choose 132 healthy males from the Island equally categorized into one of three age groups: 20-35, 36-50, 51-65. Within each group, we randomly assigned each subject a treatment of a certain exercise intensity (low/high) and time of the day (afternoon/night). We measure their melatonin levels on the night before exercising, the night of, and the night after. We created a multiple linear regression, its ANOVA table, and visuals of the data. The results showed that exercise intensity, time of the day, and age group were not significant contributors to one's change in melatonin levels after exercising, though daytime exercises resulted in a decrease regardless of the intensity. We believe that this is attributed to collecting short-term results for a measurement that changes over time, as well as collecting data 4 hours before one's melatonin secretion time due to the Island's limitations.

# Introduction

  s

  Melatonin is a hormone found in our body that regulates our sleep and body clock. Rather than increasing our drive to sleep, melatonin works hand in hand with our biological clocks to signal our brains when it is time to sleep. Known as the "Vampire Hormone", melatonin reaches its peak production at night-time and gradually declines in the morning when we are exposed to sunlight (Masters). This crucial hormone impacts our biological clock and hours needed to recharge our bodies, as shown by the prevalent use of food/drugs containing melatonin to increase melatonin levels in hopes of a better night's sleep.

  Studies have presented factors that impact the hormone's production levels. Melatonin secretion peaks during ages 2-5, then gradually decreases overtime to where the elderly manifest "an increase in sleep latency or [...] more frequent and longer-lasting nocturnal awakenings" (Wurtman). Although we cannot prevent the effects of aging, research has shown that external factors can also impact one's melatonin levels, such as physical exercises. Medical professionals discovered that the different workout intensities indeed impact one's melatonin secretion at night (Buxton), where high intensity exercises yielded significantly greater secretion levels compared to lower intensity ones and no exercise completed. Furthermore, researchers discovered that there exists "no evidence of effect modification by age, sex or body mass index" (Brown) on the effects of physical activity on melatonin levels in a year-long experiment.

  In this study, we wish to investigate how people's exercise intensity and time it is performed will affect their melatonin levels, specifically amongst males between ages 20 to 65. We choose to examine the effect of exercise because while dietary choices do affect melatonin levels, "melatonin boosts seem not to be the product of any single food or nutrients present in the diet" and have limited effects on their nocturnal melatonin levels (Puehkuri). Knowing that melatonin levels vary with age, we also will take into consideration the treatment effects on different age groups; we hope to discover how a specific exercise at a certain time will raise an age group's melatonin secretion levels to help adjust their biological clocks.


# Method and Procedures

## Participants

  s

  For this experiment, we have selected males participants from ages 20 to 65 from various cities on the island. There will be 3 age brackets: 20 to 35, 36 to 40, and 41 to 65. As mentioned in the introduction, melatonin secretion declines by age. People between these ages undergo different stages of aging and could be more prone to symptoms from the lack of melatonin, so we block participants by age to eliminate this possible contributing factor. Since people older than 65 may not necessarily be able to perform certain exercises, we decided to keep the age bracket under 65 years.
	
## Design

  s

  We adopted a two-way factorial design with blocking and interactions for this experiment, and we will be mainly focusing on the effects of time and intensity of exercises on blood melatonin secretion levels in males. We will be blocking the treatments by three age groups: 20-35, 35-50 and 50-65, since previous studies have shown that age has significant effects on melatonin levels (Karasek), yet it is not a factor that we are particularly interested in studying.

  The treatments that we will be focusing on in this study are the exercise intensity and a general time period of the day in which the exercise is performed. We have two levels for each treatment: moderate/high intensity and daytime/nighttime. We only divided the time periods into two levels because daytime and nighttime can represent whether the participants are exposed to light at the exercise time, and light is another variable which has direct correlation with melatonin levels according to previous studies. (Knight) We are also interested in the interaction between the two treatment variables, as we would like to see how different exercise intensities and at different times of the day would affect one's melatonin levels.

  Below is a detailed diagram of variables of our study and a factor diagram:

## Apparatus and Instruments

  s

  We will assign tasks virtually on the island accordingly to a participant's randomly assigned exercise schedule and intensity. Melatonin levels will be measured through blood samples. Research has shown that plasma melatonin yields the most informative results when sampled at night multiple times, compared to urine and saliva samples (Benloucif).


## Procedure

  s

  This experiment is designed to occur over 3 days, where we randomly assign participants to exercises and measure their melatonin levels before and after the activity. Since our experiment is also time sensitive, we have planned accordingly to the islanders' schedule; the island's visitor center states that islands plan to sleep at 10 PM and usually are asleep from the hours of 11 PM to after sunrise. Thus, we have decided on specific daytime/nighttime hours for the participants to exercises.

### Timeline of the experiment

- First day: Measure melatonin level at fixed time 9:30 pm at night
- Second day: Assign islanders to perform exercise according to group, measure melatonin level at 9:30 pm (to detect acute effects)
- Third day: Measure melatonin level at 9:30 pm (to detect delayed effects)

### Descriptions of Treatment 1 (Intensity)

- Moderate: "Run outdoors 2km" 
- High intensity: "Run outdoors 5km"

### Descriptions of Treatment 2 (Time)

- Daytime: 3 - 4 pm
- Nighttime: 7 - 8 pm

## Sample Size 

  s

  In our two-way factorial design with blocking, we decide to use a power of .8 and a confidence level of .05. Our effect size is .25, which will quantify a medium size of difference between groups. With the assistance of G*Power, we found out that the sample size required for our experiment to be balanced is 132, and that will leave us with 11 samples per group.


# Data Analysis

  s

  Having gathered data over the course of 3 days, we imported the dataset into R for further calculations and analysis. We compared the difference between the participants' pre-treatment melatonin levels and their post-treatment melatonin levels on days 2 and 3, then stored the maximum change in blood melatonin in a separate column. 
  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
# read data, delete last col
data <- read.csv("data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
data <- data[,-10]
data$Day2[120]<-7.6
data$Day2<-as.double(data$Day2)
data$Day2<-as.numeric(data$Day3)

data <- data %>% mutate(change1=data$Day1-data$Day2) %>% mutate(change2=data$Day1-data$Day3) %>% mutate(maxChange = data$Day1)

for(i in 1:nrow(data)){
  if(abs(data$change1[i]) > abs(data$change2[i])){
    data$maxChange[i] <- data$change1[i]
  }
  else{
    data$maxChange[i] <- data$change2[i]
  }
}
```  

### Pre-treatment Analysis: Melatonin Levels by Age Group

  s

  After gathering our pre-treatment data (i.e., the melatonin levels of all test subjects before any kind of treatment,) we used a one-way ANOVA model to check if the age groups impacted one's melatonin level, so that we could proceed with the experiment with the blocking factor in mind.

*Resulting ANOVA Table of AgeGroup*

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data, aes(x=as.factor(AgeGroup), y=Day1, fill=as.factor(AgeGroup)), fill=as.factor(AgeGroup)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=23, size=4) + geom_dotplot(binaxis='y', binwidth=1.5,stackdir='center', dotsize=0.5) + theme_minimal() + xlab("Age Group") + ylab("Blood Melatonin Level(pg/mL)") + ggtitle("Initial Melatonin Levels by Age Group") + guides(fill=FALSE) +scale_x_discrete(labels = c('20-35 years old','36-50 years old','51-65 years old'))
```

### Two-way ANOVA with AgeGroup as blocking factor
  
  s  
  
  Having gathered data from each subject over a course of 3 days, we then proceeded to conduct a Two-Way ANOVA analysis with a blocking factor to examine our results. We checked the assumptions for the homogeneity of variances first; the residuals followed a random pattern, meaning that this model is suitable for conducting the analysis. 

*Resulting Two-Way ANOVA Table*

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
# two way anova with age as blocking factor
m1 <- aov(maxChange~Intensity*Time+factor(AgeGroup), data = data)
```

```{r table3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
t <- "  
|               |   Df |Sum Sq |Mean Sq |F value |Pr(>F)  |
|---------------|------|-------|--------|--------|--------|

cat(t) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```


*Model Validity Check*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(m1)
```

### Interaction Plot

  s

  In addition, we also created an interaction plot to examine how the exercise intensity and time of the day affected one's melatonin levels. 

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
interaction <- data %>% group_by(Time=data$Time, Intensity=data$Intensity) %>% summarise(change = mean(maxChange))

interaction %>% ggplot() + aes(x = Intensity, y = change, color = Time) + geom_line(aes(group = Time)) + geom_point() + ylab("Max Change in Melatonin(pg/mL)") + xlab("Exercise Intensity") + ggtitle("Interaction Between Intensity vs Time") + theme_minimal()


```


### Change in Melatonin by Age Group

  s

  We also used several graphs such as boxplots, histograms, and the regular plots to examine the effect of the treatments on the response variable.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
# change in melatonin by age group
library(ggplot2)
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(AgeGroup), y=maxChange, fill=as.factor(AgeGroup))) + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE) + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=23, size=4) + geom_dotplot(binaxis='y', stackdir='center', dotsize=0.5) + labs(title="Max Change in Melatonin Levels by Age Group", x="Age Group", y="Max Change(pg/mL)") + scale_x_discrete(labels = c('20-35 years old','36-50 years old','51-65 years old')) +                                                                     guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Age Group"))

```


# Discussion

  s

  From the ANOVA output and visual representations, we concluded that the exercise intensity, time of the day it was finished, and their interaction are all not significant predictors of one's change in melatonin level. We see that amongst these factors, the exercise intensity had the lowest mean square value, making the interaction with time performed slightly more important than the factor itself. Although not a factor of interest, age group rendered the highest mean square value. 

  The interaction plot shows that the exercise intensity and time performed do not have an interaction, yet we can argue that there is a small amount of interaction because the lines are not completely parallel. While nighttime exercises could result in both an increase or decline in blood melatonin levels, day time exercises yielded a drop in melatonin levels regardless of the intensity of the exercise. This confirms that exposure to light will affect one's melatonin secretion, however since the time of the day is not a significant factor, it also denotes that the amount of time being exposed to light matters too, and definitely requires more than 35 minutes of continuous exercise outdoors (since this was the time most subjects took to complete the high intensity workout). Although the change is small, we can also see that high intensity exercise decreases one's melatonin level more than the low intensity one.

  The residual and distribution plots show that a multiple-linear regression model analyzed using ANOVA is suitable for our data, despite not generating significant results. Our pre-treatment analysis on melatonin levels between age groups suggests that blocking is necessary. While age was not found to be significant in the analysis, we believe it is due to the experiment's limitations rather than the factor itself.

  There are several limitations and reasons why the experiment did not result in significant findings. The medical literature we read states that one's melatonin level peaks at least past 12 AM, however due to the island's setup, we had to measure the participants' blood melatonin levels around 10:30 PM because participants sleep at 11 PM. Hence, we were unable to obtain measurements at the peak time. Also, the experiment carried out to test the effect of exercise on melatonin levels in one of the referenced articles used much higher levels of intensity; researcherx designed an hour long workout routine with various exercises, where their lowest intensity exercise was much more intense than our high level exercise. While designing our experiment, we wished to incorporate more practical and reasonable levels exercises, as we wanted to offer suggestions based on results(if there were any), thus decided on two different running distances. However, we did not anticipate that a lower intensity could render a very little effect on one's melatonin levels, as seen from its low mean square value in the ANOVA output too. Furthermore, we believe that the biggest reason why our experiment did not render significant results is due to the short duration of the experiment. Researchers have stated that "a study of a single dose of melatonin does not permit an assessment of its hypnotic qualities and withdrawal effects after long-term use", hence have developed at least week-long experiments on factors that could impact melatonin.

# Conclusion

  s

  Disruptions in sleep patterns are caused by various factors. From a biological perspective, age and light exposure from various sources are two large ones that affect one's melatonin secretion. While people take melatonin supplements to temporarily solve their sleep probles, we wanted to discover a more natural and healthy means to adjust one's sleep cycle.
  
  In this project, we wished to investigate the extent to which exercise intensity and the time of the day it is performed affect melatonin levels. Since melatonin secretion is affected by age, we also blocked subjects into three age groups. Our results show that the two variables and their interaction factor are not significant predictors of one's maximum change in the blood melatonin levels after exercising. We can confirm that one's original melatonin levels vary by age group, however they do not differ in the amount of change over two days after exercising. Furthermore, the maximum change in melatonin for all age groups are centered around zero and are distributed normally. Although the interaction term is not significant, it shows that light exposure indeed can decrease one's melatonin levels, regardless of the degree of exercise intensity, which also is related to the length of the workout. Considering that our intensity levels could be augmented, we conjecture that a longer time spent outdoors would yield a greater decrease.

  With explanations regarding the results in mind, we would improve on this experiment by adjusting the exercise intensities and extending the experiment's duration. As we have employed a 2^2 factorial design, the differences are more easily detected when the differences in the factor levels are large. This compounded with information from one of the research papers suggests that we should increase the intensity for both levels or exercises and create a greater difference between the two. We would also extend the experiment to at least two weeks along for one's melatonin level to potentially adjust to a new cycle, as experiments where subjects directly consume melatonin spanned for at least a week long. This way we could possibly detect greater changes in melatonin levels overtime after they have stablized and may see differences between the 4 treatment groups.
